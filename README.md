# 🌸 Tic Tac Toe — Vibecoded Mini Game 🌸

🔗 **Live demo:**  
https://v0-tic-tac-toe-feminine.vercel.app/

A soft, feminine Tic Tac Toe game built as a **vibecoding experiment** using **v0.dev** and refined manually within a few hours.

The goal of this project was not to over-engineer a classic game, but to explore **rapid UI iteration**, **emotional UX**, and **clean state management** under tight time constraints.
